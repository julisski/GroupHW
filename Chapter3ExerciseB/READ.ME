Chapter 3 Exercise B
Bingo Game Simulation
Directions: Write a text-based concurrent program in Java that fulfills the requirements shown
in the C++ program Bingo-Game-Simulation. Do this by using threads in Java. The algorithms
used in the program and the format of the program’s output should be the same as that
produced by the C++ program. Put your completed Java source code files into a single zip file.
Then submit your zip file on the course website on Blackboard.
